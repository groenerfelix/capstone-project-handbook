It allows you to easily trace, synchronize, and revert your changes. Git is commonly used in collaborative projects. If you have never used git before, you should install GitHub Desktop for the easiest way to interact with git:</p> <ol> <li>Download GitHub Desktop from desktop.github.com </li> <li>Install the application on your computer </li> <li>Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your GitHub account. If you don't have an account, create one at github.com </li> <li>Create a new one in GitHub Desktop by clicking \u201cFile\u201d, then \"New repository\", and select your project folder. If someone else on your team has already created and uploaded the shared repository (see below), then you would \"Clone repository\" instead of \"New repository\".</li> </ol> <p>Whenever you make changes to your code, you will see them listed in GitHub Desktop. When you want to create a snapshot of your current state, you need to commit your changes. In GitHub Desktop,  1. Write a clear, descriptive commit message (e.g., \"Add user login functionality\" instead of \"updates\"). 2. Click \"Commit to main\" to save the snapshot locally 3. Click \"Push origin\" to upload your snapshot to the shared GitHub repository.</p> <p>If there are any files that you don't want to upload to GitHub, then create a <code>.gitignore</code> file in the repository folder (i.e., your project folder).

Go to your repository on github.com 2. Click \"Settings\" and then \"Manage access\" 3. Click \"Invite a collaborator\" 4. Enter their GitHub username and send the invitation.</p> <p>To make sure that everyone on the team has the same code, you should run git pull everytime before you start to work on something. <code>Pull</code> pulls the changes that your teammates have made in the meantime from the shared repository into your local repository.</p> <p>This is a very valuable skill to learn!</p> <p>Git and GitHub are used in almost all software development jobs.
